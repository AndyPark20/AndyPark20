Hello World! 👋🗺️
---
My name is Andy, a full stack web developer, with a deep passion to create function dream(){return 'imagination into reality'}
What did I do before becoming a programmer? Const {college, buyer, sales/account manager} = AndyPark.history                           
I love meeting and collaborating with people so lets talk 🤝!
