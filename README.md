Hello World! 👋🗺️
---
My name is Andy, a full stack web developer, with a deep passion to create function dream(){return 'imagination into reality'}                             
What did I do before becoming a programmer? Const {college, buyer, sales/account manager} = AndyPark.history                                                            
I love meeting and collaborating with people so lets talk 🤝!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: A full Stack flight tracker application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Stacks data structure, React redux & hooks.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Airplane✈️ was my office at one point & I have a big appetite🍲 (You'll be shocked!)
